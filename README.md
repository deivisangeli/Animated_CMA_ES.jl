This is a problem set exercise.

## For grader:

Professor Schrimpf suggested we do not spend much more than
6 hours in this problem set. It took me quite some time to
make the gif, so I ended up not optimizing too much my code.

For instance, I am quite sure that there are better ways to
set up my matrix operations.
